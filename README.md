## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Saabithsp/PaymentGateway.git
    cd PaymentGateway
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   You need to install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

    - For frontend:

      ```bash
      cd client
      npm install
      ```

    - For backend:

      ```bash
      cd ../backend
      npm install
      ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

    In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file and add the following:

    ```env
    MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
    PORT=5000
    ```

4. **Running the application:**

   In the root of the project, you can run both the frontend and backend using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start both the client (React) and the backend (Node.js) concurrently.

5. **Accessing the application:**

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the frontend.
